app/vista_forum/page.tsx(4,24): error TS2614: Module '"./CategoryTabs"' has no exported member 'CATEGORIES'. Did you mean to use 'import CATEGORIES from "./CategoryTabs"' instead?
app/vista_forum/page.tsx(178,31): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ id: any; title: any; summary: any; category_id: any; categories: { name: any; }[]; thumbnail_url: any; view_count: any; created_at: any; }[]' to type 'Post[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type '{ id: any; title: any; summary: any; category_id: any; categories: { name: any; }[]; thumbnail_url: any; view_count: any; created_at: any; }' is not comparable to type 'Post'.
    Types of property 'categories' are incompatible.
      Property 'name' is missing in type '{ name: any; }[]' but required in type '{ name: string; }'.
